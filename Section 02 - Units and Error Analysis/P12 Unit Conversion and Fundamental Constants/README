Unit Conversion and Fundamental Constants

Purpose
This program performs unit conversions across various physical quantities such as length, mass, time, volume, energy, temperature, amount, pressure, and velocity. It also includes functionality to display a table of fundamental constants along with their values and units.

How it Works
1. Users choose a type of conversion (e.g., length, mass, etc.).
2. The program prompts for the input and output units and the value to convert.
3. Conversion factors are applied to compute the result, supporting bidirectional conversions.
4. The program also includes a table of fundamental constants that can be printed in a text-friendly format for reference.

Features
Comprehensive Unit Conversion: Supports conversions for:
  - Length (e.g., meters, kilometers, miles, etc.)
  - Mass (e.g., kilograms, pounds, atomic mass units, etc.)
  - Time (e.g., seconds, minutes, years, etc.)
  - Volume (e.g., liters, gallons, etc.)
  - Energy (e.g., joules, electronvolts, calories, etc.)
  - Temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)
  - Amount (moles, particles)
  - Pressure (e.g., atmospheres, Pascals, psi, etc.)
  - Velocity (e.g., meters per second, mph, fraction of the speed of light, etc.)

Fundamental Constants Table: Displays constants such as:
  - Speed of Light
  - Planck Constant
  - Gravitational Constant
  - Avogadro's Number
  - Electron Charge
  - Boltzmann Constant
  - Etc..

Interactive Loop: Allows users to perform multiple conversions in a single session.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, pandas
