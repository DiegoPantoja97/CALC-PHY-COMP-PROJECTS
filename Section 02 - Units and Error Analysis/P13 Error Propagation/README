Error Propagation

Purpose
This program calculates the first-order propagation of uncertainties for a multivariable function. It is useful for estimating the error in a computed quantity based on the errors in the measured variables.

How it Works
1. The function to evaluate is predefined in the code.
2. Users input arrays of measured values and their uncertainties for the variables.
3. Partial derivatives of the function with respect to each variable are calculated symbolically using sympy.
4. The program computes the propagated uncertainty using the formula:
   σ_f = √(Σ_i [(∂f/∂x_i) * σ_x_i]^2)
5. The result includes the evaluated function value and the propagated uncertainty.

Features
Predefined Function: Function is defined in the code (e.g., f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y * z).
Dynamic Variable Input: Users provide measured values and uncertainties as arrays.
Symbolic Differentiation: Uses sympy to calculate partial derivatives.
Error Propagation Calculation: Computes the propagated uncertainty based on first-order error propagation formula.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Libraries: numpy, sympy
