Title
Projectile Motion Simulations 

Purpose
This project provides an interactive visualization of projectile motion, allowing users to observe the effects of varying launch parameters. It includes animations and plots to analyze the trajectory, 
time of flight, apex height, and horizontal range for different scenarios. The project aims to enhance understanding of kinematic principles and the physics of projectile motion.

Features
1. Single trajectory simulation with real-time updates
   Animates the motion of a projectile launched at a specified velocity and angle
   Displays dynamic annotations for apex height, time in air, and final horizontal range
2. Multi-trajectory comparison
   Simulates and visualizes the trajectories of projectiles launched at multiple angles simultaneously
   Highlights the effect of launch angle on horizontal range, showcasing maximum range at 45 degrees
3. Interactive animations embedded directly in Jupyter Notebook
4. Grid-aligned visualizations with labeled axes for precise interpretation of data
5. Dynamic legends and titles to enhance plot clarity

Dependencies
1. Python 3.x
2. Matplotlib for plotting and animations
3. NumPy for numerical calculations
4. IPython for HTML embedding (animations in Jupyter Notebook)

How to Use
1. Adjust the initial conditions such as launch angle, velocity, and height directly in the code
2. Execute the provided scripts in a Jupyter Notebook or compatible Python IDE
3. Observe the animations and analyze the corresponding position vs. time plots
4. Use the calculate_time_of_flight function to validate time of flight calculations for custom inputs

Potential Applications
Educational demonstrations of physics principles in classrooms
Experimenting with varying launch conditions for engineering or research simulations
Exploring the effects of gravity and angle variations on projectile trajectories
