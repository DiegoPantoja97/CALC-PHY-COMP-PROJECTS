Rotating Frame Simulation

Purpose
This project simulates the motion of particles within rotating and non-rotating reference frames to visualize concepts such as Coriolis force and centripetal acceleration. 
The animation provides an intuitive understanding of how objects move differently in inertial and non-inertial frames, with a focus on straight-line motion relative to the center of a rotating disk.

Features
- Plot of Particle stuck in uniform circular motion with live velocity and acceleration tracking vectors
- Rotating Disk Animation: Visualizes a disk rotating at a specified angular velocity.
- Inertial Frame Simulation: Displays particles following straight-line trajectories toward the center, superimposed on a rotating disk.
- Non-Inertial Frame Simulation: Simulates the same particle motion as observed in a rotating reference frame, illustrating curved trajectories.
- Interactive Visualizations: Animations dynamically show particle trajectories, disk rotation, and the differences between frames.

Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- Matplotlib: For generating animations and visualizations.
- NumPy: For numerical calculations, such as trajectory computations and coordinate transformations.
- IPython: For embedding animations in Jupyter Notebooks.
