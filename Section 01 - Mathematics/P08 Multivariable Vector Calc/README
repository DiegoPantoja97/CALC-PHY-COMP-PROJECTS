Project: Multivariable and Vector Calculus Tools

Purpose:
This project provides numerical and visual tools for solving problems in multivariable and vector calculus. It includes implementations for surface and curve plotting, derivative estimation, integral computation, and optimization with constraints.

Features:
1. Surface and Curve Visualization:
   - Plot surfaces of multivariable functions and parameterized surfaces.
   - Generate 2D and 3D plots for parameterized curves.

2. Derivative Estimation:
   - Compute first and second-order partial derivatives for 2D and 3D functions using finite difference methods.
   - Plot tangent planes to surfaces at specified points.

3. Integral Calculations:
   - Compute line integrals along parameterized curves.
   - Evaluate surface integrals using vector fields and parameterized surfaces.
   - Perform volume integrals in Cartesian and generic coordinate systems with variable bounds.

4. Vector Field Analysis:
   - Visualize 2D and 3D vector fields with magnitude-based coloring.
   - Compute vector derivatives such as gradient, divergence, and curl.

5. Contour Plots:
   - Generate contour plots for 2D multivariable functions.

6. Optimization:
   - Solve constrained optimization problems using Lagrange multipliers implemented with numerical solvers.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
