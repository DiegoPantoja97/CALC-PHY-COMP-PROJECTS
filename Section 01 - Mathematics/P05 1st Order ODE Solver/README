Project: First-Order ODE Solver

Purpose:
Solve first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerically using three different methods and compare their results.

Features:
1. Numerical Methods:
   - Euler's Method: A straightforward iterative method for approximating ODE solutions.
   - Improved Euler's Method (Heun's Method): A refined version of Euler's method for increased accuracy.
   - RK4 Method: A fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for high-accuracy ODE solutions.

2. Visualization:
   - Individual plots for each method showcasing their approximations.
   - A combined plot for comparing the results of all three methods.

3. Customizability:
   - User-defined initial conditions (`x0`, `y0`).
   - Custom input for the endpoint of the range (`x_end`) and the number of steps (`n`).
   - Replaceable function definition (`f(x, y)`) for solving different ODEs.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
