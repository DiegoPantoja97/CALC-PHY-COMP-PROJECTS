Project: Basic Data and Statistical Analysis

Purpose:
This project provides a basic introductory framework for performing data analysis and visualization, covering importing data, computing descriptive statistics, regression analysis, curve fitting, and error analysis. It serves as an introduction to handling and analyzing data programmatically using Python.

Features:

1. Data Import and Conversion
   - Imports data from Excel or CSV files.
   - Converts the data into NumPy arrays for analysis.

2. Descriptive Statistics
   - Computes key statistics including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, interquartile range (IQR), and percentiles.
   - Provides a clear summary of data properties.

3. Visualization
   - Creates box-and-whisker plots with key statistics marked and annotated.
   - Generates scatter plots with optional known curves for comparison.
   - Displays histograms for visualizing data distribution.

4. Regression Analysis and Curve Fitting
   - Performs linear regression to determine best-fit lines and computes R-squared values.
   - Fits custom curves to data using user-defined functions.

5. Error Analysis
   - Incorporates error bars into scatter plots.
   - Plots expected curves alongside data points with error bars for comparative analysis.

6. Applications
   - Suitable for analyzing experimental or synthetic datasets.
   - Provides insights into data trends, variability, and relationships between variables.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
