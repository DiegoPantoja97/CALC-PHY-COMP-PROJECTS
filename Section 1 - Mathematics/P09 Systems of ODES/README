Project: Systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)

Purpose:
This project provides numerical and analytical tools for solving systems of ordinary differential equations, with applications to linear and nonlinear systems, both first-order and second-order. It includes methods for explicit solutions, numerical integration, and phase portrait analysis.

Features:
1. RK4 Method for General Systems:
   - Solves any system of first-order ODEs using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method.
   - Suitable for nonlinear and non-autonomous systems.

2. Linear Systems of ODEs:
   - Solves linear systems of the form \( \frac{dy}{dt} = Ay + b(t) \).
   - Computes solutions using the matrix exponential \( e^{At} \) and variation of parameters for the particular solution.

3. Second-Order ODE Systems:
   - Directly solves second-order ODEs (e.g., coupled oscillators) without converting to a system of first-order equations.
   - Includes phase portrait visualization for second-order systems.

4. Phase Portrait Analysis:
   - Visualizes the behavior of solutions in phase space.
   - Computes vector fields to indicate trajectories for first-order systems.

5. Forcing and Nonhomogeneous Terms:
   - Handles systems with forcing terms and computes particular solutions via variation of paramater - integral methods.

6. Numerical Stability and Accuracy:
   - Employs finite difference methods for stability in second-order ODE systems.
   - Supports normalized vector fields for clear phase portraits.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
