Project: Linear Algebra Basics and Applications

Purpose:
This project provides an example-based implementation of various linear algebra concepts and operations typically encountered in a linear algebra course. The aim is to demonstrate how basic and advanced linear algebra can be performed using Python.

Features:
1. Matrix and Vector Basics:
   - Define vectors and matrices (row and column).
   - Perform slicing and indexing to extract submatrices and elements.

2. Matrix Representations:
   - Compute derived representations such as transpose, diagonal, triangular matrices, and inverse.
   - Perform operations with conjugates and Hermitian transpose.

3. Vector Operations:
   - Compute dot products, cross products, outer products, and vector magnitudes.
   - Demonstrate vector addition and linear transformations.

4. Matrix Creation:
   - Create matrices with zeros, ones, or custom values.
   - Fill diagonals and generate random matrices with various distributions.

5. Matrix Operations:
   - Perform matrix multiplication, compute determinants, and evaluate commutators/anti-commutators.
   - Apply matrices to vectors and analyze the results.

6. Matrix Power Series:
   - Approximate functions of matrices (e.g., exponential, sine, cosine) using power series expansions.

7. Linear Transformations:
   - Apply predefined transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, reflection, shear) in R^2 and R^3.
   - Visualize the effects of transformations on vectors and points.

8. Matrix Classification:
   - Classify matrices as symmetric, Hermitian, orthogonal, unitary, triangular, singular, nilpotent, and more.

9. Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Analysis:
   - Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
   - Perform diagonalization and validate transformations using matrix reconstruction.

10. Matrix Decomposition:
    - Implement LU, QR, SVD, and Eigenvalue decompositions.
    - Validate results by reconstructing the original matrix.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy (for advanced decompositions)

This project serves as a practical introduction to computational linear algebra, making it easier to understand how theoretical concepts translate into practical applications using Python.
