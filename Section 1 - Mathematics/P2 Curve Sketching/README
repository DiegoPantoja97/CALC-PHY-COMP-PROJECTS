Purpose

Visualize and approximate a mathematical curve using tangent lines and scatter plots with linear interpolation.

Features

Tangent Line Approximation:
Generates tangent lines across the curve for visualization.
Superposes tangent lines with the original function.
Provides a standalone tangent line approximation plot.


Scatter Plot Approximation:
Generates scatter points along the curve.
Interpolates the curve with linear segments.
Plots both the original function and linear interpolation.
Customizable input for x-range, number of points, and step size.
