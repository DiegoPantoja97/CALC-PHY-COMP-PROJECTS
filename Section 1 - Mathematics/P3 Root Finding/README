Purpose
Solve for the roots of a mathematical function using numerical methods, specifically Newton's Method and the Bisection Method, while providing a visualization of the function for initial estimation.

Features
Newton's Method:
Uses numerical derivatives to iteratively converge to a root.
Requires an initial guess for root estimation.

Bisection Method:
Utilizes bracketing of roots within an interval and iteratively reduces the interval size.
Ensures convergence if the root exists within the specified interval.

Function Plotting:
Visualizes the function over a specified range to assist in selecting initial guesses and intervals.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
