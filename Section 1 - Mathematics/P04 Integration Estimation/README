Project: Definite Integral Estimation

Purpose:
Estimate the area under a curve for a given mathematical function using numerical integration methods, and visualize both the exact area and approximations.

Features:
1. Numerical Integration Methods:
   - Left Endpoint Approximation: Uses the left endpoints of intervals to estimate the area.
   - Right Endpoint Approximation: Uses the right endpoints of intervals to estimate the area.
   - Midpoint Approximation: Uses the midpoints of intervals for better accuracy.
   - Trapezoid Rule: Approximates the area using trapezoidal slices.
   - Simpsonâ€™s Rule: Provides a higher-order approximation by combining parabolic arcs.

2. Visualization:
   - Plots the exact area under the curve as a shaded region.
   - Visualizes the area approximated by geometric rectangles for selected methods (left, right, or midpoint).

3. Interactive Inputs:
   - Allows users to input bounds (a, b) and the number of intervals (n).
   - Interactive selection of the approximation method for visualization.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
