Project: Tangent Line and Derivative Estimation
Purpose
This project allows users to interactively estimate the derivative of a given mathematical function at any point using various numerical approximation methods. The project also visualizes the tangent line at the specified point, providing insights into the function's behavior.

Features

Implements Forward, Backward, Symmetric, and High-Order Difference methods for derivative approximation.
Allows users to input custom points and step sizes (x0, h) for derivative estimation.
Visualizes the tangent line at the point of interest and plots it alongside the function.
Interactive functionality to repeatedly compute derivatives for multiple points.
Dependencies

Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib


Project: Higher-Order Derivative Estimator
Purpose
This project extends the numerical differentiation techniques to compute higher-order derivatives (up to the fourth derivative) of a mathematical function.

Features

Estimates 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th derivatives using central difference methods.
Accepts user-defined points (x0) and step sizes (h) for greater flexibility.
Prints the numerical values of the derivatives for analysis.
