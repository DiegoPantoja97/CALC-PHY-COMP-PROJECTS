Project 19

Coupled Oscillators Simulation and Visualization

Purpose
This project simulates and visualizes the dynamics of two masses connected by three springs using numerical methods. It provides both a real-time animation of the system's behavior and static plots of the displacement over time. This serves as an educational tool to understand coupled harmonic oscillators and their numerical solutions.

Features
Dynamic Visualization Animates the motion of the two masses in real time, showing their oscillations and the changing lengths of the springs.
Numerical Simulation Solves the coupled differential equations governing the system using Python's solve_ivp with the RK45 method.
Static Plotting Plots displacement versus time for both masses to analyze their behavior.
Customization Adjustable parameters for spring constants, masses, and natural lengths.
High-Resolution Animation Supports extended simulation times with smooth animations.

Dependencies
To run this project, ensure the following Python libraries are installed

numpy For numerical calculations.
matplotlib For plotting and animations.
scipy For solving differential equations.
IPython For embedding animations in Jupyter Notebook.
