Project 17

Title

Inclined Plane Block Simulation and Comparison with Free-Falling Ball

Purpose

Demonstrate classical mechanics concepts involving friction, free fall, and motion on an inclined plane. The project covers:
1. Rendering a plane and a block with force vectors  
2. Simulating the block sliding down if friction is overcome  
3. Dropping a ball (in free fall) alongside for comparison  
4. Visualizing results through an animation and time-series plots  

Features

1. Static Incline Figure  
   Renders an inclined plane at angle θ, with a block placed at the top.  
   Shows mg, N, friction f, and the mg sinθ and mg cosθ components.  

2. Block Sliding Simulation  
   Uses simple friction logic.  
   If mg sinθ ≤ μ mg cosθ, the block remains at rest; otherwise, it slides down.  

3. Animation (Block on Plane vs. Free-Falling Ball)  
   The block slides down; a ball is dropped from the same height in free fall.  
   Highlights that the free-falling ball generally accelerates more quickly.  

4. Vertical Position Plot  
   Compares y(t) of both objects, illustrating the block’s slower descent due to friction and plane geometry.

Dependencies

- Python 3  
- NumPy for array handling
