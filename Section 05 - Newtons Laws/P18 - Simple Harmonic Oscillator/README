Project 18

Title
SHM Visualization and Dynamic Simulation

Purpose
This project provides a comprehensive visualization and simulation of simple harmonic motion (SHM). It includes both static and animated visualizations of a mass-spring system, along with the ability to dynamically explore the general solution of SHM using interactive sliders.

Features
1. Static visualization of a mass-spring system with annotated vectors for displacement, restoring force, and velocity.
2. Animated simulation of a block's motion in SHM with a dynamically scaled velocity vector.
3. Additional animations showing the evolution of position, velocity, and acceleration over time.
4. Interactive plot for the general SHM solution, allowing real-time adjustments to parameters such as spring constant (k), mass (m), amplitude (x₀), and phase shift (ϕ).

Dependencies
1. Python 3.x
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib
4. SciPy
5. IPython (for interactive HTML animations and slider support)

This project offers a modular and user-friendly approach to exploring the behavior of SHM in both static and dynamic contexts. Perfect for physics education, research, and demonstrations.
