Project 20


Double Atwood Machine Simulation

Purpose
This project simulates the motion of a **Double Atwood Machine**, a system involving three masses connected by ropes and pulleys. The simulation animates the resultant motion of the masses based on given accelerations derived from the equations of motion.

Features
- Computes accelerations of each mass based on their respective equations of motion.
- Simulates the positions of the masses over time using numerical integration.
- Animates the motion of the masses with horizontal offsets for clarity.
- Adjustable parameters for mass values, rope lengths, and gravitational acceleration.

Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy` for numerical computations.
- `matplotlib` for creating the animation and visualizing the motion.
- `IPython` for embedding the animation inline in Jupyter Notebooks.
